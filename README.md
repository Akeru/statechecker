# StateChecker

State Checker is an ACI app that will allow you to snapshot a subset of objects in the fabric and compare them. This will allow you to answer questions like 

* What changed in my fabric between windows 
* Are my critical objects the same after maintenance 
* Are all my routes/endpoints still present

StateChecker is available on the appstore (insert-link-here) and can be deployed on in standalone mode with the ability to connect ACI fabrics.  Further details can be found on [readthedocs](https://statechecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
